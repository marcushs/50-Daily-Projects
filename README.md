# 50-Daily-Projects

This is my 50 day daily practise.

For 50 days, I code every day a mini project using HTML, CSS and Javascript to sharpen my skills and learn by doing as a beginner.

I follow the tutorials on the platform Udemy, a course created by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.

Here is the link to the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

For every project, I first watch the introduction video about the project, then think about how I would implement the code before watching the actual tutorials.

Then I code along with the videos, understand the logic behind it. Sometimes I add more features or modify some code according to my preferences.

Once finished I usually delete the code (usually just the JS part), and do it again on my own to see if I truly understand.

I review previous days code regularly.
